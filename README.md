## About the game
Game of life is an infinite two dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell has eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent.

## Rules
1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.  
2.Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.  
3.Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.  
4.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
